Hence all actions\\nmust be weighed against this one statement.\"  whatever helps this goal is\\n\"moral\", whatever does not is \"immoral\"\\n\\nOf course this leads such a blank space: there are so many different ways to\\nfulfill a goal, one would need a \"hyper-morality\" to apply to just the methods.\\n\\n&gt;I never thought of eating meat to be moral or immoral, but I think\\n&gt; it could be.  How do we differentiate between not doing something because it is\\n&gt; a personal choice or preference and not doing something because we see it as \\n&gt; immoral?  Do we fall to what the basis of these morals are?\\n\\nSeems to me we only consider something moral or immoral if we stop to think\\nabout it long enough  :)  On the other hand, maybe it is our first gut\\nreaction...  Which?  Who knows: perhaps here we have a way to discriminate\\nmorals.  I don't instinctively thing vegetarianism is right (the same way I\\ninstinctively feel torture is wrong), but if I thought about it long enough and\\nlistened to the arguments, I could perhaps reason that it was wrong (is that\\npossible!?  :) )  See the difference?\\n\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Also, consensus positions fall to a might makes right.

What\\n#&gt;right do we have to expect others to follow our notion of societally\\n#&gt;mandated morality?  Pardon the extremism, but couldn't I murder your\\n#&gt;\"brother\" and say that I was exercising my rights as I saw them, was\\n#&gt;doing what felt good, didn't want anyone forcing their morality on me,\\n#&gt;or I don't follow your \"morality\" ?\\n# \\n#I believe that morality is subjective.  Each person is entitled to his\\n#own moral attitudes.  Mine are not a priori more correct than someone\\n#elses.  This does not mean however that I must judge another on the\\n#basis of his rather than my moral standards.  While he is entitled to\\n#believe what his own moral sense tells him, the rest of society is\\n#entitled to pass laws spelling out punishments for behavior that is\\n#offensive to the majority.\\n\\nWhy?  Your last statement.  Why?  By which authority?  \\n\\n#Most criminals do not see their behavior as moral.  The may realize that\\n#it is immoral and not care.  They are thus not following their own moral\\n#system but being immoral.  For someone to lay claim to an alternative\\n#moral system, he must be sincere in his belief in it and it must be\\n#internally consistent.  \\n\\nWhy?  Your last statement.  Why are these things necessary?  \\n\\nAnd believe me, a belief in terrorism can be both sincere and frighteningly\\nconsistent.\\n\\n#Some sociopaths lack an innate moral sense and\\n#thus may be incapable of behaving morally.  While someone like Hitler\\n#may have believed that his actions were moral, we may judge him immoral\\n#by our standards.  Holding that morality is subjective does not mean\\n#that we must excuse the murderer.\\n\\nTrouble is, this would sound just fine coming from someone like Hitler, too.\\n(I do *not* mean any comparison or offence, David.)

Did I misunderstand?\\n|&gt; \\n|&gt; Reading newspapers to learn about this kind of stuff is not the best idea in\\n|&gt; the world.  Newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of\\n|&gt; religion, and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a \"real\"\\n|&gt; story (that is, a bigger headline).\\n|&gt; \\n|&gt; Let's back up to 1935.  At this point, we have the Masoretic text, the\\n|&gt; various targums (translations/commentaries in aramaic, etc.), and the\\n|&gt; Septuagint, the ancient greek translation.  The Masoretic text is the\\n|&gt; standard Jewish text and essentially does not vary.  In some places it has\\n|&gt; obvious corruptions, all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy.\\n|&gt; These passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and\\n|&gt; to the Septuagint.\\n\\nSo when they took the time to *copy* *the* *text* correctly, that includes\\n\"obvious corruptions?\"\\n\\n|&gt; \\n|&gt; Now, the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars:\\n|&gt; first, it includes additional texts, and second, in some passages there are\\n|&gt; variant readings from the masoretic text (in addition to \"fixing\"/predating\\n|&gt; the various corrupted passages).  It must be emphasized that, to the best of\\n|&gt; my knowledge, these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars, and\\n|&gt; have little theological import.\\n\\nSo when they took the time to *copy* *the* *text* correctly, that does not\\nexclude \"variant readings from the masoretic text\" which are \"of little \\ntheological import\"\\n\\n|&gt; \\n|&gt; The dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient *copy* of almost all of\\n|&gt; Isaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books.  There\\n|&gt; is also an abundance of other material, but as far as I know, there is no\\n|&gt; sign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha (the extra texts in the\\n|&gt; septuagint).  As far as analysis has proceeded, there are also variations\\n|&gt; between the DSS texts and the masoretic versions.  These tend to reflect the\\n|&gt; septuagint, where the latter isn't obviously in error.  Again, though, the\\n|&gt; differences (thus far) are not significant theologically.  There is this big\\n|&gt; expectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the\\n|&gt; material, but so far this hasn't happened.\\n|&gt; \\n|&gt; The DSS *are* important because there is almost no textual tradition in the\\n|&gt; OT, unlike for the NT.\\n\\nHey, you're the expert.\\n\\njon.\\n</td>\n",
